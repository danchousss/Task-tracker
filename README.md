## 📖 Background Review

Teamwork and communication are crucial in software development and student projects. Many students work in small teams but struggle to organize their work and track tasks.  
Existing tools like Jira, Trello, and Asana are often too complex for small student teams, which leads to using chats like Telegram or WhatsApp, where tasks and information can easily get lost.  

**Goal:** Provide a simple project management system to help students collaborate effectively and manage tasks clearly.

---

## ⚠ Problem Statement

Effective communication and task management remain challenging in small teams:

- Non-technical members struggle to track technical tasks and communicate requirements.  
- Developers have difficulty staying updated on project priorities and feedback.  
- Existing tools are often too complex, expensive, or not user-friendly for small teams.  

**Need:** A simplified, intuitive, and user-friendly task management system suitable for both technical and non-technical users.

## 💡 Problem Solution

The **Task Flow** system addresses these challenges by:

- Allowing creation, assignment, and tracking of tasks  
- Enabling communication via task comments or updates

- Managing user roles with proper access control  
- Offering a clean, intuitive interface for all users
